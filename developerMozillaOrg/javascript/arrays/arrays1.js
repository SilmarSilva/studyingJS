/*
Let's start off with some basic array practice. In this task we'd like you to create an array of three items, stored inside a variable called myArray. The items can be anything you want â€” how about your favourite foods or bands?

Next, modify the first two items in the array using simple bracket notation and assignment. Then add a new item to the beginning of the array.

Try updating the live code below to recreate the finished example:
*/


// Add your code here

// Don't edit the code below here!

section.innerHTML = ' ';
let para1 = document.createElement('p');
para1.textContent = `Array: ${ myArray }`;

section.appendChild(para1);
